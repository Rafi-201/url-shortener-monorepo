# Monorepo for Independent URL Shortener Apps

This repository is a <strong>monorepo</strong> that houses multiple independent applications, including Node.js-based URL shorteners, message brokers, and database services. Although these applications are stored in a single repository, they operate entirely independently, with each app maintaining its own dependencies, configurations, and environment.

## Why Use a Monorepo?

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplified Management</strong>: All applications are organized in a single repository, making it easier to manage and maintain them collectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralized Version Control</strong>: Track changes, manage issues, and submit pull requests for all apps from one centralized location.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent Apps</strong>: Each app is fully self-contained, with its own set of dependencies, configurations, and environment settings, ensuring they remain isolated and modular.</li>
</ul>
