Monorepo for Independent Node.js Apps
This repository is a monorepo containing multiple independent Node.js applications. Although the apps are housed together in this repository, they operate completely independently, each with its own dependencies, configuration, and environment.

Why a Monorepo?
Simplified management: All apps are stored in a single repository for easier management.
Centralized version control: One place to track changes, issues, and pull requests for all apps.
Independent apps: Each app is fully self-contained, with its own set of dependencies and configurations.
