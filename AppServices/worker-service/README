How to Run the Worker Service:
Build and Run Worker Service:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t worker-service .
docker run -d --name worker-service worker-service
Check Logs: You can monitor logs using docker logs worker-service.

Scaling and Load Handling:
RabbitMQ: It will distribute the load evenly across the worker instances, allowing horizontal scaling of worker services.
Bulk Inserts: The Worker Service accumulates messages and performs bulk inserts, which optimizes database interactions.
Database: Ensure your database is optimized for high insert rates (e.g., using bulk insert operations, indexing, etc.).
