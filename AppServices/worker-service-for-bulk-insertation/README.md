Worker Service for Bulk Insertion
This repository contains a worker service that listens for messages from RabbitMQ, processes them, and performs bulk insertion of URL mappings into a database. The service is built using Clean Architecture principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

Directory Breakdown

1. src/adapters/
   This folder contains the "Adapters" layer, which translates between external systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, database) and the core business logic.

in/ (Input Adapters): Contains adapters that listen for incoming data (e.g., messages from RabbitMQ) and pass it to the use cases.

RabbitMQConsumer.ts: Listens to messages from RabbitMQ and forwards them to the appropriate business logic service (ProcessMessageService).
out/ (Output Adapters): Contains adapters that handle output communication (e.g., interacting with the database).

repositories/: Contains the repository interfaces and their implementations.
UrlRepository.ts: This is the interface for interacting with the database to insert UrlMapping data.
db/: Contains the database interaction layer.
DatabaseAdapter.ts: Concrete implementation for interacting with the database. This might use a database client like TypeORM or Sequelize, depending on the application.
controllers/: Contains adapters that manage request/response (if required).

UrlController.ts: This file can handle API requests related to URL mapping if the worker service is exposed via HTTP endpoints. 2. src/core/
This folder contains the "Core" layer, which includes the business logic and domain model of the application.

entities/: Contains domain entities that represent the core data of the system.

UrlMapping.ts: Represents the core entity of the system that holds the mapping between the original URL and the shortened URL.
useCases/: Contains the application business logic or use cases.

BulkInsertService.ts: Contains the logic for handling bulk insertions of URL mappings into the database.
ProcessMessageService.ts: Contains additional business logic for processing incoming messages, such as validating or transforming the data.
dtos/: Contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that represent the data structures used to communicate between layers.

UrlDto.ts: Represents the structure of the data related to URL mappings that are transferred across layers.
interfaces/: Contains interfaces that define the contracts for the repository and other external interactions.

UrlRepository.ts: This interface defines the contract for the repository methods used to interact with the database. 3. src/infrastructure/
This folder contains the "Infrastructure" layer, which handles the external systems and utilities like configuration, logging, and error handling.

config/: Contains the application's configuration files for various services.

appConfig.ts: App-level configuration (e.g., environment settings).
rabbitmqConfig.ts: Configuration related to RabbitMQ.
dbConfig.ts: Configuration related to the database connection.
utils/: Contains utility classes and cross-cutting concerns.

Logger.ts: A logger utility for logging messages across the application.
ErrorHandler.ts: Optional utility to centralize error handling and logging. 4. src/index.ts
This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the necessary services (like the RabbitMQ consumer) and starts the worker service.

5. Dockerfile
   The Dockerfile is used to containerize the worker service. It specifies how to build and run the application inside a Docker container.

6. package.json
   The package.json file contains information about the project and its dependencies. It also includes npm scripts for running the application.

7. README.md
   This file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and how to run the worker service.

Core Concepts
Clean Architecture Principles
Separation of Concerns: The application is split into layers, with each layer focusing on a single responsibility. The core business logic is decoupled from infrastructure concerns like messaging (RabbitMQ) and data storage (database).
Dependency Inversion: Core business logic (use cases) does not depend on the database or RabbitMQ. Instead, it depends on interfaces that are implemented in the infrastructure layer.
Testability: The use of interfaces ensures that each component can be independently tested.
Flexibility and Maintainability: The application is designed to be flexible and maintainable by isolating changes in the infrastructure layer from the core business logic.
How the Components Interact
RabbitMQ Consumer (RabbitMQConsumer.ts) listens to messages from RabbitMQ.
It passes the incoming message to the ProcessMessageService, which contains the core business logic.
The BulkInsertService handles bulk insertion of URL mappings into the database by interacting with the UrlRepository.
The UrlRepository (implemented in UrlRepository.ts) communicates with the database via DatabaseAdapter.ts to persist the data.
Running the Service
Setup and Install
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy
npm install
Run the application:
bash
Copy
npm start
Running with Docker
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy
docker build -t worker-service .
Run the Docker container:
bash
Copy
docker run -p 8080:8080 worker-service
Further Considerations
Error Handling: Ensure that proper error handling is implemented in production code, especially when dealing with external systems like RabbitMQ and databases.
Scalability: As the service is processing messages and doing bulk inserts, consider implementing batch processing techniques and optimizing database operations for scalability.
Unit and Integration Tests: Implement unit tests for core business logic and integration tests for end-to-end communication with RabbitMQ and the database.
